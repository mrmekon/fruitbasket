//! fruitbasket - Framework for running Rust programs in a Mac 'app bundle' environment.
//!
//! fruitbasket provides two different (but related) services for helping you run your
//! Rust binaries as native AppKit/Cocoa applications on Mac OS X:
//!
//! * App lifecycle and environment API - fruitbasket provides an API to initialize the
//!   AppKit application environment (NSApplication), to pump the main application loop
//!   and dispatch Apple events in a non-blocking way, to terminate the application, to
//!   access resources in the app bundle, and various other tasks frequently needed by
//!   Mac applications.
//!
//! * Self-bundling app 'trampoline' - fruitbasket provides a 'trampoline' to
//!   automatically bundle a standalone binary as a Mac application in a `.app` bundle
//!   at runtime.  This allows access to features that require running from a bundle (
//!   such as XPC services), self-installing into the Applications folder, registering
//!   your app with the system as a document type or URL handler, and various other
//!   features that are only available to bundled apps with unique identifiers.
//!   Self-bundling and relaunching itself (the "trampoline" behavior) allows your app
//!   to get the features of app bundles, but still be launched in the standard Rust
//!   ways (such as `cargo run`).
//!
//! The primary goal of fruitbasket is to make it reasonably easy to develop native
//! Mac GUI applications with the standard Apple AppKit/Cocoa/Foundation frameworks
//! in pure Rust by pushing all of the Apple and Objective-C runtime logic into
//! dedicated libraries, isolating the logic of a Rust binary application from the
//! unsafe platform code.  As the ecosystem of Mac libraries for Rust grows, you
//! should be able to mix-and-match the libraries your application needs, pump the
//! event loop with fruitbasket, and never worry about Objective-C in your application.
//!
//! # Getting Started
//!
//! You likely want to create either a [Trampoline](struct.Trampoline.html) or a
//! [FruitApp](struct.FruitApp.html) right after your Rust application starts.
//! If uncertain, use a `Trampoline`.  You can hit very strange behavior when running
//! Cocoa apps outside of an app bundle.

///
/// You must follow all of the standard requirements for NSApplication.  Most
/// notably: FruitApp **must** be created on your app's main thread, and **must**
/// be pumped from the same main thread.  Doing otherwise angers the beast.
///
/// An application does *not* need to be in a Mac app bundle to run, so this can
/// be created in any application with [FruitApp::new](FruitApp::new).  However, many Apple
/// frameworks *do* require the application to be running from a bundle, so you
/// may want to consider creating your FruitApp instance from the [Trampoline](Trampoline)
/// struct's builder instead.
